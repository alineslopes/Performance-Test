# K6 Performance Testing Project

This project is a robust performance testing suite using the [K6](https://k6.io/) tool, focused on the demo API: [https://test-api.k6.io](https://test-api.k6.io).

## What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing is the process of evaluating a system's behavior under certain workloads, measuring aspects such as:

- Response time
- Throughput
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Stability and scalability

The goal is to ensure the application meets performance requirements under real or extreme conditions.

## How to Run the Tests

1. Install [K6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder

To run a quick smoke test:

```bash
k6 run smoke/smoke-test.js

Scenario Details

Login with CSV
Uses the papaparse library to parse data from the data/users.csv file.

Each virtual user selects a random user from the CSV to simulate varied logins.

Creating and Deleting Posts
First obtains a token via login.

Creates a post (crocodile) with random data generated by the function in utils/dataGenerator.js.

At the end, deletes the created post to keep the environment clean.

---

Next Steps and Improvements
Add update (PUT/PATCH) and delete tests for other resources.

Integrate with visualization tools (Grafana/InfluxDB).

Run tests in CI/CD pipelines.

Generate automated reports.
